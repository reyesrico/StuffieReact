# Security Update: CVE-2026-23950

## Summary
This document describes the security fix applied to address **CVE-2026-23950**, a high severity race condition vulnerability in the `tar` library (node-tar).

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2026-23950
- **Package**: tar (node-tar)
- **Severity**: High (CVSS Score: 8.8)
- **CWE**: CWE-176 (Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding)
- **Advisory**: [GHSA-r6q2-hw4h-h46w](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r6q2-hw4h-h46w)

### Description
The vulnerability arises due to path reservations being bypassed via Unicode ligature collisions on macOS APFS file systems. This could potentially allow attackers to exploit filesystem race conditions during tar extraction operations, leading to:
- Arbitrary file overwrites
- Path traversal attacks
- Potential code execution through malicious tar archives

### Affected Versions
- tar <= 7.5.3

### Patched Versions
- tar >= 7.5.4

## Resolution

### Changes Made
1. **Removed npm dependency**: The npm package (v11.7.0) was listed as a dependency in package.json, which included a bundled tar@7.5.2 that could not be overridden. Since npm is not used in the application code, it was removed.

2. **Updated tar override**: Updated the tar version override in package.json from `^7.5.3` to `^7.5.6` to ensure any transitive dependencies use the patched version.

3. **Updated package-lock.json**: Regenerated package-lock.json to reflect the removal of npm and ensure no vulnerable tar versions are installed.

### Verification
After the fix:
- No instances of tar package found in dependency tree
- `npm audit` reports no tar vulnerabilities
- Application builds successfully with `npm run build`

## Additional Notes
The tar library is commonly used as a transitive dependency in Node.js projects through packages like:
- npm (package manager itself)
- node-gyp (native addon build tool)
- pacote (npm package downloader)

By removing the npm dependency and updating the override, we've eliminated the vulnerability from the project's dependency tree.
